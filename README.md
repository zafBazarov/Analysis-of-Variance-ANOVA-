# Analysis-of-Variance-ANOVA-
# The folder contains four exercises with a variety of questions and a bit of data. Here's my response. Most of the questions are about ANOVA. R is what I use for my analyses. I took the exercises in my Applied Statistics class. 

# Here are the questions for the exercise

# (a) What is the response variable (dependent variable)?, What is the factor variable (independent variable)?, What are the factor levels? , How many replications are there per factor level?, What is the sample size N?
# (b) What is the research question?
# (c) Is the design balanced or unbalanced? 
# (d) Visualize the data. Describe what you see in the plots. 
# (e) Estimate the means and variances for the factor levels. 
# (f) Carry out a Bartlett test. Do the factor levels have equal variances? 
# (g) Carry out an analysis of variance., What are the null and the alternative hypotheses? 
# (h) Estimate the effects of the factor levels., What do the numbers mean? 
# (i) Check for outliers.
